#neural-cam
neural-cam turns your USB camera into object detector that detect or classify objects it seen before. The backend framework used is darknet developed by Joseph Redmon. This version is modified and compiled with cmake. Feel free to modify to your own use, at your own risk.

Current Feature:
- training/evaluate yolo detector

Usage Details:
- mkdir build
- cd build and cmake ..
- make
- ./main train (for training the detector, use darknet19_448.conv.23 in onroad_cfg/full_model_3class folder)
- ./main eval <device number> (for evalution of the detector, e.g: "./main eval 0" means accessing "/dev/video0")

Changes: (from v1.5 onwards)
- Opencv component is installed into image.c file, provide a more convenient way for loading images
- Since Opencv function is used in the core libraries, Opencv 3.1 is required for cmake
- setup.cfg is used for loading of configuration, just have to modify this file

Requirements:
- cmake 2.8 above
- runs on opencv 3.1
- ubuntu 14.04 above
- cuda 7.5 above (modify the CMakeList.txt if you dont have a GPU!)
- latest nvidia graphic driver 367.48
